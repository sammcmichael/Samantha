			<h3> We made a Magic 8 ball for our project. The user can as a question and the program will ask "how many shakes", once the user responds the magic 8 ball will appear with a yes/no/maybe answer to the question.</h3>
			<h1>Mouse maze game</h1>

			<h3> We made a maze when the player can move the mouse through the maze while trying to collect randomly positioned pieces of cheese along the way to the exit of the maze. When cheese is collected it will add a point to the scoreboared.</h3>

			<h3> We created a sandwich shop game where a customer asks for a random sandwich and the user has to click on the right ingredients for the sandwich. If the ingredients match the customer's request you get a dollar and if not you get it wrong and have 3 chances before the game ends.</h3>

			<h3> In this project we had to debug the code and fix all of the index errors so that all element values in the fish tank were correct. </h3>
			 <h1>Rover Phone Home</h1>
			<img src="marsh lands.jpg" width="500" height="375" class="aligncenter">
			<h3> In this project we had to determine the location of a rover based on sesnor values. We decided that the rover was in the Marsh Lands because the small deviation in the angular position of the rover told us it was likely in a location with flatter grounds. The constant higher sound told us it was likely slightly noisy where the rover was and the noise was constant. The quick change in light could be caused from the change of night time to day time or from the rover coming out from a shady position. And the constant temperature corresponds with the little temperature changes in the marshlands.  </h3>
			<h1>Honey Bee Production</h1>
			<img src="honey production.PNG" width="500" height="375" class="aligncenter">
			<h3> In this project we looked at the production of honey in the United States through visuals like graphs. We also sorted and cleaned out data to show the truly important data. </h3>

			<h3> In this project, we analyzed the blood sugar NetLogo system, and we saw how the blood suagr changed as factors like insulin, glucose, and glucagon changed. </h3>
